> Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: [**Static Generation**](http://next.org) and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

## Understanding channels in golang

- consider a channel to be a tunnel which helps in passing data between processes
- Channels enables us to communicate between goroutnies

## Buffered vs Unbuffered channels

```go:main.go showLineNumbers
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func main () {
    start:= time.Now()
    resp:= make(chan any,2)

    go fetchPosts(resp chan any)
    go fetchUserLikes(resp chan any)

    for data:=range resp {
       fmt.Println("response:  ",data)
    }
    fmt.Println("took: ",time.Since(start))
}

```

## Why i transitioned to Typescript and why you should too!

- **Typescript** - provides its retrictions and helps to identify bugs during development of your app.
- **Security** -Why you should use TypeScript over [JavaScript](http://vitejs.dev)?
- Image result for why to use typescript
  In contrast to JavaScript, TypeScript code is more reliable and easier to refactor. This enables developers to evade errors and do rewrites much easier.
